    <h1>How Git Works</h1>
    <h3>Edison Jao</h3>
    <p>
      Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of your
      source code history. It is primarily used for source code management in
      software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any
      set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at
      speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
