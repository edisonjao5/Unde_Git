    <h1>How Git Works</h1>
    <h3>Edison Jao</h3>
    <p>
      Git is a version control system that allows you to keep track of your
      source code history. It is primarily used for source code management in
      software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any
      set of files. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at
      speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

      Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux
      kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial
      development. Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano. Git is
      free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU
      General Public License version 2.
